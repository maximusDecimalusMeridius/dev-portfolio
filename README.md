# Dev Portfolio
## Description

This project was assigned at the end of Week 1 - assignment details can be located in Assignment.md.  This will serve as a repository of links and resources showcasing my learnings and progression as a full-stack developer.  It's built to be responsive down to 350 pixels and at all large formats.  All images and icons were generated by me with AI prompts using [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com).
